## Instalation

I am yet to distribute this as a pip (I may do it if people are interestes).
 So in the meantime you have some prep work to do to use this package.
 it is an easy 4 step process.

 you need to install maturin 
 pip install maturin
 and numpy 
 pip install numpy

you need rust to compile the backend
to install rust go to : https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
and follow the instruction usually it just required to copy paste a link in the terminal.

then you need to compile the backend
here you have the option to either add it to your local python or virtual env.
you can find detailed explanation here: https://github.com/PyO3/maturin (instead of <maturin build> you might use <maturin develop>)

For the rest of the tutorial we will simply add it to the default python3 of your system

using the terminal cd to the directory Rust_covpyo3
then run the following command.

cargo build --release
maturin build --release

depending your internet connexion it may take anything between 30 secondes to 5 minutes

ae are almost there, maturin create what we call a wheel which is a the compiled librayr that python now how to work with
we just need to tell python it exists.

in case you created multiple wheel I would recommand you clean the content of this directory and run maturin once again

Rust_covpyo3/target/wheels/

to install it run:
python -m pip install -U Rust_covpyo3/target/wheels/*.wheel

now you can use this package.

## Usage
The workhorse of this package is the rust backend that can be accessed using either the following function
The continuous tag is a legacy feature that may be remove in the future.

get_cover_for_a_bam(intervalls, bam, continous=True)



parse_bam_mp(args)
